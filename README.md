# Hybrid Soft Continuum Arm Dynamics (Modal Space Formulation)

This repository contains MATLAB code to simulate the **joint-space dynamics** of a hybrid soft–rigid continuum arm using a **modal space formulation (MSF)**.  
The model corresponds to a soft module actuated by **three pneumatic muscle actuators (PMAs)**, and the implemented dynamics use the modal coordinates associated with PMA 2 and PMA 3.

The equations of motion implemented in the MATLAB functions are **analytically derived in Maple 2020**.  
Both the **original Maple worksheet** and its **exported PDF** are provided in this repository for transparency and reproducibility.

## Demo

A short demo of the simulation and visualization is included as `demoVideo.mp4` in the root of the repository.
